# TODO - Style My TodoList App - COMPLETED

## Plan:
- [x] Create comprehensive CSS stylesheet with all components styled
- [x] Update HTML to remove unnecessary Bootstrap dependency
- [x] Verify the design is cohesive and responsive

## Components Styled:
- [x] Main app container - Centered, card-like, max-width 520px
- [x] Header / title - Clean typography with Bebas Neue
- [x] Input field + add button - Styled form with focus states
- [x] Todo list items - Individual rows with checkbox, text, actions
- [x] Completed state - Muted styling with strikethrough
- [x] Delete button - Danger color (#e74c3c) for destructive action
- [x] Edit button - Mid-blue (#59A5D8) for secondary action
- [x] Empty state - Friendly message when no todos
- [x] Footer - Subtle, professional styling
- [x] Mobile layout - Responsive design with breakpoints

## Design Choices Made:
- Deep-blue gradient background (#133C55 to #0d1b2a) for the page
- White cards (#ffffff) for container and todo items
- Primary blue (#84D2F6) for accents
- Rounded corners: 6px (subtle, not overly bubbly)
- Shadows: subtle using --shadow variable
- Transitions: 0.25s for smooth interactions
- Typography: Arimo (body) + Bebas Neue (header)
- Spacing: 8px base unit for consistency
- Custom checkbox with success color
- Smooth animations for add/remove
- Scrollbar styling
- Accessibility: focus-visible states
